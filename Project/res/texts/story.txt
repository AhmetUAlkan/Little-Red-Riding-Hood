In order to survive and save the grandma
Now she have to run and build a bridge
Heard the howl of the wolf
The bridge was broken, reason unknown
She went to see her grandma
Surrounded with forest and cold
Her grandma lived in a small island
Had a grandma whom she loved
Who lived in peace and calm
Once upon a time, there was an innocent girl
